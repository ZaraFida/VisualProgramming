Visual programming is a method of programming where users interact with graphical elements to create code, instead of writing text-based code. It uses visual representations like blocks, flowcharts, or diagrams to represent programming concepts and logic. This approach is beginner-friendly, making it easier for users to understand and create programs without needing advanced coding knowledge.
